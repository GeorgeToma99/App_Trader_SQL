# App Trader Data Analysis and Investment Pitch## IntroductionApp Trader is a data analysis project aimed at evaluating a business case and making investment recommendations. Our team worked with a database of phone apps and their key metrics to figure out the most promising investment opportunities. We then pitched our top 10 app picks to stakeholders. This project required advanced SQL (PostgreSQL) skills, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, casting, and aggregations.## Technologies- PGAdmin 4- SQL (PostgreSQL)- Canva (for creating the presentation)## Features- SQL scripts- Presentation slides for stakeholders## Scope- We analyzed two tables of app data: one for iPhone apps and one for Android apps.

While the task and tutorial links provided some guidance, the presentation, queries, and analysis were created by my team and me. You can find the original README in the questions folder above.
